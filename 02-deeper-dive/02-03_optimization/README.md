![](../../.gitbook/assets/optimization.png)

In this chapter, weâ€™ll look at:

* what is optimization
* objective functions
* constraints
* data
* defining goals and objective criteria
* genetic algorithms
* the initialization phase
* the evaluation phase
* the selection phase
* the crossover phase
* the mutation phase
* other applicable techniques

First, let's explore what _`optimization`_ means in relation to AEC and generative design.
