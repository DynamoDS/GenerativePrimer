# What are Algorithms?

![](../../.gitbook/assets/whatarealgorithms%20%282%29.png)

An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations involving a computer. A generative design approach involves several distinct steps with distinct kinds of algorithms to encode logic at each step. The types of methods used in each step are very different from each other, so we generally categorize them as follows:

| Step | Algorithm Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| generation of new design studies | generators |
| evaluation of each study | evaluators |
| ranking & solution achieves goal | solvers |
