In this chapter, weâ€™ll look at what the term _`Generative Design`_ means in relation to AEC and generative design.

We would go through the following subjects:

* [What is generative design?](01-02_what-is-generative-design.md)
* [Why should I use generative design?](01-03_why-should-i-use-generative-design.md)
* [What goes into a generative design process?](01-04_what-goes-into-a-generative-design-process.md)
* [Examples of Generative Design](examples-of-generative-design/)
