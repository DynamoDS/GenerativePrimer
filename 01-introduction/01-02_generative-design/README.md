# Generative Design

In this chapter, we’ll look at:

* common approaches in practice now
* a definition of generative design in the context of AEC
* what is Refinery
* the fundamental concepts needed to understand generative design
* examples of using generative design to solve a design problem
* related concepts

Let’s start by first looking at something you’re very likely to be aware of and already using today: computational design.
