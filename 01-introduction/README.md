# Introduction

In this chapter, we’ll look at key concepts that are essential to understand generative design and how project refinery works. 

We would approach the following subjects:

* The fundamental concepts needed to understand generative design
* A definition of generative design in the context of AEC
* An introduction to what is Refinery
* Examples of using generative design to solve design problems
* Related concepts
* Common approaches used

Let’s start by first looking at something you’re very likely to be aware of and already using today: computational design.
